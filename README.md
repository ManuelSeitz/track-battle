<img src="./screenshots/game-screenshot-1.png" alt="Game screenshot" style="width:1024px;margin:10px;object-fit:cover">
</div>

1. Click on the _green up arrow_ if you think the artist who isn't showing the followers has **MORE** followers.
   Otherwise, click on the _red down arrow_ if you think the artist who isn't showing the followers has **LESS** followers.

2. If you guessed, you'll see a check animation and a new artist will show up 😄.

<div align="center">
<img src="./screenshots/game-screenshot-2.png" alt="Another game screenshot" style="width:1024px;margin:10px;object-fit:cover">
</div>

3. If you didn't, you'll see a game over screen, showing your score.

<div align="center">
<img src="./screenshots/game-screenshot-3.png" alt="Another game screenshot" style="width:1024px;margin:10px;object-fit:cover">
</div>

Aditionally, you can click on the artist's name to see their Wikipedia article.
